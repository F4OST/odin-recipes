     <p style="color:#F4D79D;" ><strong> Our meal today features the classic Middle Eastern combination of falafel and ayran</strong></p>
     <p> Falafel is a delicious and nutritious vegetarian dish made from chickpeas, herbs, and spices,<br>
         and is often served in pita bread with a variety of sauces and vegetables<br>
         Ayran is a refreshing yogurt-based drink that helps cool down the spiciness of the falafel and complements its flavors perfectly<br>
        Together, these dishes make for a satisfying and flavorful meal that is both healthy and delicious</p>

    <p> <b>In addition to being a delicious meal</b><br> falafel and ayran have a rich history that reflects the diverse culinary traditions of the Middle East<br>
      Falafel is believed to have originated in Egypt or Palestine, where it was traditionally made with fava beans.<br> Over time, the recipe evolved to include chickpeas, which are now the most commonly used ingredient in falafel.<br> Today,
      falafel is enjoyed throughout the Middle East and beyond, and is a staple of vegetarian and vegan diets.</p>
